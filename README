A simple program illustrating Arnold's Cat Map using opencv.
This is an example of a chaotic mapping of a square image
with N rows and N columns exhibiting Poincare recurrence 
after some number of iterations.

The transformation is:

  x(n+1) = (2*x(n)+y(n)) mod(N)
  y(n+1) = (x(n) + y(n)) mod(N)

In general, the recurrence time, T is:
log(N)/(golden ratio) < T < 3*N
